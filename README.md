By filling out a brief configuration file, CorporateWeapon can quickly...  

- Open specific templates for the task at hand
- Perform multiple find-and-replaces
- Format and fill tables
- Add conditional text
- Copy to clipboard
- Save and export to pdf

CorporateWeapon can also do many small quality of life formats like:

- Fix encoding issues (change '\&amp;' to '&' etc.)
- Add states to addresses
- Format currencies with commas
- Space out phone numbers for readability
- Capitalise sentences
- Sum related amounts

This is a generalised version of the software. Developed for my job where i found i was filling out the same templates many times everyday. Code that handles internal procedures has been removed.
